This is the code used in the development of SHYFT.

Shyft was a 5 week project to see what kind of quality I could push out in a limited time span. The game was written in Javascript for Unity 5.3 and was the first major game project I undertook.

The code is all publicly available but is very raw, this was a learning experience.
